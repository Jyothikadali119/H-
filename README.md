SQL Roots - 
The SQL language was first developed in the 1970s --> IBM researchers ----> Raymond Boyce and Donald Chamberlain 
based on the relational model developed by Edgar F. Codd in 1970. 
He wrote the paper, "A Relational Model of Data for Large Shared Data Banks," which provided a theoretical base for working with structured data. 
This research led to the first **Commercial Relational Database Management Systems**, ---> Oracle in 1979, SQL/DS in 1981, and DB2 in 1983. 
As you can see, SQL is an old programming language, so why is it still relevant and why do I need to learn it? There's an easy answer to this. Many companies still use it. According to the 2020 Insights from Stack Overflow, SQL is the third most commonly used programming language behind JavaScript and HTML and CSS.
